# ðŸ”€ Transfer assets to Astar Network EVM

Astar Network uses two different but related networks, **Astar Substrate and Astar EVM**.

The Astar portal is a gateway between those networks, and the portal uses ASTR tokens for gas fees.&#x20;

_If you need ASTR tokens to do a transaction, you can claim free ASTR on the Astar Portal or Astar Discord._

**Algem is, at the moment, only deployed on Astar EVM.** Therefore, to use Algem, you must transfer assets such as ASTR tokens to your Astar EVM wallet.

To do so, you have five options.

1. Withdraw from a CEX supporting Astar EVM&#x20;
2. Transfer from Astar substrate to Astar EVM using the Astar portal&#x20;
3. Use a bridge&#x20;
4. Cross-chain swap assets
5. Buy ASTR tokens on a DEX.
