# ðŸ“ƒ Contracts information

## Security deployment and contract administration

Algem contracts are deployed using GitHub CI and incorporate OpenZeppelin library modules, bolstering protocol dependability.

A majority of these contracts are designed for upgradability. When engaging with such contracts, remember to exclusively employ the Proxy address.

## Role-based smart-contact management

Algem employs a role-based system for managing smart contracts. This entails confining vital operations to the multisig wallet, while routine, non-critical actions are permissible via the ordinary wallet. This system encompasses two distinct roles:

* **DEFAULT\_ADMIN\_ROLE**

3/4 Gnosis Safe Multisig controlled by the two Algem team members and two Astar Network Core team members.&#x20;

Multisig address: [0xf1893e221227ff7B28D0dBe4dc367F54AAf9BEBD](https://blockscout.com/astar/address/0xf1893e221227ff7B28D0dBe4dc367F54AAf9BEBD) (Astar Network mainnet).&#x20;

All the contracts changes and grant/revoke role operations could be made only under the DEFAULT\_ADMIN\_ROLE (via the multi-signature transaction).

* **MANAGER**

Regular address with Algem development team access.&#x20;

Manager address: [0xf9B9068276163f47cd5599750496c48BeEba7B44](https://blockscout.com/astar/address/0xf9B9068276163f47cd5599750496c48BeEba7B44) (Astar Network mainnet).&#x20;

This role is used for the non-crucial operations which cannot affect the security level of the dApp such as setting the minimal staking amount, etc.

For a comprehensive rundown of operations allocated to each role, please refer to the [Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMPk0\_uk=/) provided.

## Pause Functionality

The pause feature serves to halt contracts temporarily during incident response.&#x20;

Presently, it's activated for the following contracts:

* Liquid Staking
* NASTR
* Sio2 Adapter

Pause functionality adheres to the Pausable module standard within the OpenZeppelin library for all these contracts.

**Contract.pause()**\
Pause a contract by setting the paused boolean flag to True.

**Contract.unpause()**\
Unpause a contract that was previously paused, re-enabling exchanges.

**Disabling functionality:**

1. Liquid Staking\
   All calls to contract functions are blocked.
2. NASTR

* transfer()
* transferFrom()
* mint()
* burn()

3. Sio2 Adapter

* supply()
* withdraw()
* borrow()
* addSTokens()
* claimRewards()

## Timelock

Our contracts operate without a time-lock function, as administrative actions are exclusively managed through the multi-signature wallet's address. This design guarantees swift execution of administrative decisions, eliminating the necessity for time-based delays, all the while upholding a secure and well-regulated environment.

## On-chain threats monitoring system

Presently, the Algem team is actively investigating on-chain monitoring systems, akin to the functionality offered by platforms such as [Forta](https://forta.org/).
