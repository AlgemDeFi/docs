# ðŸŒ€ Using Astar Network Portal

If you hold ASTR tokens in your substrate wallets such as Polkadot.js, Talisman, Subwallet, or others, you can transfer your tokens to an EVM wallet through the Astar Network Portal.

1. First, copy your EVM address (Metamask or Talisman)&#x20;
2. Connect your substrate wallet to Astar Portal and click "transfer."&#x20;
3. Past your EVM address and enter the amount of ASTR you want to send&#x20;
4. Confirm the transfer

Please visit the official Astar documentation for a completed guide for token transfer between substrate and EVM wallets.
