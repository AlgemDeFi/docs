Once Algem has delegated your ASTR tokens to Astar dApp Staking, you will receive the same amount as the amount deposited in nASTR tokens and start earning staking rewards.

You can add the nASTR token to Metamask by adding the following token address or using the dedicated feature in Algem dApp.

_**nASTR:**_ 0xE511ED88575C57767BAfb72BfD10775413E3F2b0

* To unstake your nASTR tokens and redeem ASTR tokens, you must first switch to ‚Äúunstake‚Äù mode;
* Enter the nASTR amount you wish to unstake from the selected dApp;
* You can unstake from one, several or all dApps at the same time.
* Select the[ unstaking parameters](https://docs.algem.io/algem-protocol/liquid-staking/unstaking-nastr) (regular or immediate) and accept the conditions;
* Confirm your action by clicking the ‚Äúunstake‚Äù button.

You will receive your ASTR tokens directly into your wallet after fulfilling the unstaking conditions (e.g. unbonding period).
