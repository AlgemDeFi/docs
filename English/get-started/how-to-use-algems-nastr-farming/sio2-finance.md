# üçã SiO2 Finance

[SiO2 Finance](https://www.sio2.finance/) is the multi-VM lending hub on Astar for Polkadot. They aim to become the best lending product with excellent user experience, easy-to-use one-click features, and transparent governance.

Algem‚Äôs nASTR Farming is now supporting SiO2 Finance. nASTR holders can lend their tokens as collateral to borrow other assets available on the lending platform such as ASTR, DOT, USDT, USDC, WBTC, WETH, etc.

## How to supply your nASTR and borrow on SiO2 Finance

Once you have staked ASTR tokens on [algem.io](http://algem.io/) and received nASTR tokens, select SiO2 Finance in the nASTR farming.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Before borrowing other assets on SiO2, be sure to understand** [**the concept of Health Factor, Borrowing limit and liquidation using a lending plateform**](https://app.gitbook.com/s/YrkY8PCzzyHqe2iNEHfd/\~/changes/4/get-started/how-to-use-algems-nastr-farming/sio2-finance#be-aware-of-risks)**. ‚ö†Ô∏è**

From the launch of the adapter, only the ASTR token can be borrowed for the first few weeks, to avoid the risk of liquidation while Algem users familiarize themselves with the concept of the lending platform.

### **nASTR Market Details:**

**Loan to Value : 50%** - You can borrow up to 50% of your nASTR Collateral Value;

**Liquidation Threshold : 60%** - Up to 60% of a borrower's debt is repaid and that value + liquidation fee is taken from the collateral available.

_The liquidation threshold is typically higher than the LTV ratio. For example, if the liquidation threshold for an asset is 60%, and a borrower has borrowed to the maximum LTV of 50%, if the value of their collateral falls such that their loan now represents 60% or more of the value of their collateral, their collateral will be liquidated._

_Example: Suppose a user deposits 10000 ASTR worth $1000 as collateral. With an LTV ratio of 50%, they can borrow up to $500 worth of another asset. If the price of ASTR drops such that the value of their collateral falls to $833.33, their loan now represents 60% of the value of their collateral ($500/$833.33 = 60%). At this point, the platform will initiate liquidation of the borrower's collateral to repay the loan._

**Liquidation Penalty : 12.50%**

_The liquidation penalty is an additional charge that is applied when a borrower's collateral is liquidated. This serves as a deterrent to borrowing more than can be safely repaid, and provides additional security to lenders._

_The liquidation penalty is added to the amount the borrower owes at the time of liquidation. The borrower's collateral is sold off until the loan plus the liquidation penalty is repaid._

_Example: Using the same example, suppose there's a 12.5% liquidation penalty. If the borrower's loan of $500 is being liquidated, an additional $62.5 (12.5% of $500) is added to the amount they owe. Their collateral will be sold off until $562.5 is repaid._

### **How to increase your Health Factor:**

* Repay your borrowing position;
* Supply more collateral (nASTR);

### **Claim your rewards from the nASTR Farming**

* Select the SiO2 Fiance dApp in the farming section;

## A Defi strategy using Algem and Si02 Finance :

This is an example of a Defi strategy using SiO2 on Algem to maximize liquid dApp staking and earn more staking rewards with a set amount of ASTR tokens :

* Stake 1000 ASTR on Algem, receive 1000 nASTR;
* Lend 1000 nASTR on Si02 on Algem‚Äôs Farming;
* Borrow up to 500 ASTR;
* Stake again 500 ASTR on Algem and receive 500 nASTR;
* Collect your staking rewards;

From 1000 ASTR, you are now receive staking rewards of 1500 nASTR (1000 ASTR deposited + 500 ASTR borrowed).

## Be aware of risks!

Before using a Lending protocol like SiO2 Finance, be sure you are aware of the risks:

* **Liquidation:** Like all types of lending, Defi lending carry the risk of borrower default. When a user borrows on a lending platform, a "health factor" is associated with his or her position. The health factor (HF) is an indicator of the security of a deposited position compared to a borrowed position. The higher the HF, the safer the deposited assets are from liquidation. \
  \
  If the HF falls below 1, the deposited assets may be liquidated. A liquidation is a process in which up to X % of a borrower's debt is repaid, and this value + the liquidation fee is taken from the user's available collateral. After liquidation, the liquidated amount of debt is repaid. To avoid liquidation, make sure your HF is greater than 1. \
  \
  A user can increase his HF by depositing more collateral assets or by repaying part of the loan. See more in [SiO2 Finance‚Äôs documentation](https://sio2-finance.gitbook.io/en/systems/risk-parameters).
* **Smart-contract risks.** SiO2 Finance is developed based on Aave V2 which is already [heavily audited](https://docs.aave.com/developers/v/2.0/security-and-audits). SiO2 has been also [audited by PeckShield](https://github.com/SiO2-Finance/contracts/tree/main/audits) but please keep in mind that security audits don‚Äôt completely eliminate risks. \
  Do not supply assets that you cannot afford to lose to SiO2 Finance as a lender.
