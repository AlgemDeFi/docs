# ü¶à How to use Algem's nASTR Farming

The nASTR Farming ‚Äì which we previously referred to as nASTR Liquidity Hub ‚Äì is a group of **intermediate contracts** that replicate our DeFi dApps partners‚Äô interface on Algem‚Äôs app.

Once you have staked your ASTR tokens on Algem and received your nASTR, you can choose one of the available protocols where you want to use your tokens.

At the moment, the three dApps supported by the Algem Adapter Contracts are Sirius Finance, Kagla Finance and Arthswap.

**For all the users farming already with nASTR tokens on Sirius or Kagla Finance, you must stake your Gauge tokens in Algem‚Äôs nASTR Farming to keep earning staking rewards.**
