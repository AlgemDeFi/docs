# ðŸª™ ALGM token

**ALGM** is the native and governance token of the Algem protocol, and it has a central role in the reward and voting system of the platform. Following Astar Network's values, we decided not to make any of our governance tokens available for sale to the community. At Algem, we believe that it's best to distribute ALGM only to users and supporters of our project.

_Therefore, the only way to receive governance tokens before being listed on exchanges is to lock ASTR or get an airdrop._
