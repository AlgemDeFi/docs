# âš– Protocol revenues

Algem protocol revenues come from two different sources:

* **Fees.** In return for its services, Algem charges a small fee for its various features:&#x20;
  * Liquid Staking management fee (10% fee on staking reward)&#x20;
  * Immediate unstaking fee (1% on the unstaking amount)&#x20;
  * Liquid Lending management fee (10% fee on lending reward)&#x20;
  * nASTR Farming fee (10% fee on partner's farming reward)
* **Build2Earn reward.** Algem is part of the Astar Builders program. As a result, Algem generates operator rewards from Astar dApp Staking during each Astar era through its pool on the Astar portal. Users can follow the reward distribution on Subscan.
