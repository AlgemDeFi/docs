To fully understand all the mechanics of Liquid Farming, it is recommended to review our [FAQ ](https://docs.algem.io/algem-protocol/liquid-lending/faq)and [Whitepaper](https://github.com/AlgemDeFi/White-Paper) before making a deposit.

### Guide

#### Step 1: Connect Your Wallet and generate your referral code

1. Go to[ lf.algem.io](https://lf.algem.io/) and connect your wallet.
2. (Optional but Recommended!) If you want to participate in the referral program:

* Generate a referral code and share it with your friends and in the Algem Discord server.
* You can also apply another user's referral code when making a deposit.
* Why is this important? Users who apply another user‚Äôs referral code receive a 5% bonus on their points. So, don‚Äôt just share your own code‚Äîuse someone else‚Äôs as well!

#### Step 2: Supply Liquidity

4. Supply tokens (ETH and ERC20 tokens - yaySTONE, yayAgETH, or wstETH). These will be sent to the AMM pools.

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXd6E28KvlY7_03VmKyvfAO_br8mfIEYbXmUIDwgjbaeEMVkzC40UXshFuIP2flJMjaD5H35lc9jl0YpHSN8_ShGKnrq7JEQEmr_VWom6Sg9IMFw1JKQFqzy7R-qfb2gvrc0rDvylA?key=pF7RjHSc-l04WnS7X6LePsnq)

üö® Important Notes:

* You must supply an equal value of ETH and ERC20 tokens.
* Depositing is a two-step process:

1. Approve the transaction
2. Confirm the deposit

Once your deposit is complete, you will receive liquid lfETH tokens (LWRAPPED). These represent your ETH liquidity in the pool.

‚ö†Ô∏è Attention! The number of lfETH tokens received may slightly differ from the amount of ETH you deposited due to minor conversion differences.

üîπ Tip: You can add the lfETH token to your wallet immediately after the transaction for easier tracking.

üöÄ Coming Soon: The first use cases for your lfETH tokens will be introduced within the next few weeks! We strongly recommend not transferring your lfETH tokens to other addresses before this time, as doing so will result in losing access to the underlying ETH! üö®

#### Step 3: Reward Generation

Once your deposit is complete, you will start earning rewards.

* You will receive ALGM incentives and farming rewards after one full ERA (which is equivalent to 24 hours in Liquid Farming).
* Each ERA starts every 24 hours:
* The first ERA begins on Monday at 00:00 UTC.
* Example: If you deposit your tokens on Monday at 5:30 PM UTC, your first rewards will be available on Wednesday after 00:00 UTC.

#### Step 4: Claim & Re-stake or Withdraw

Once rewards are available, you can choose to:

‚úÖ Claim & Re-stake ‚Äì Add your ALGM farming rewards in the staking pool\
‚úÖ Claim & Withdraw ‚Äì Take out your ALGM and farming rewards at any time.

üö® Attention! If you do not re-stake your ALGM tokens when claiming rewards, your farming rewards will gradually decrease over time!

#### 4. Redeem your deposit.

If you decide to exit Liquid Farming, you can redeem your deposit at any time.

* Your lfETH tokens will be burned upon redemption.
* You will receive:

‚Äî Your initial deposit (ETH & ERC20 tokens)

‚Äî Farming rewards

‚Äî ALGM incentives

üö® Important Notice:

* The exact amount of tokens you receive upon redemption may differ in proportion from what you originally deposited.
* Example: You may receive more ETH and fewer ERC20 tokens or vice versa.
* However, excluding impermanent loss, the total USD value of your redeemed assets will match what you initially deposited.
