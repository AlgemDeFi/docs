# ðŸ’¦  Liquid dApp Staking

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O6eHya-hvU&t=2s" %}

**Liquid staking** is the first and primary feature of the Algem protocol that leverages the Astar network's dApp staking.

Algem's liquid staking solution allows users to continue to earn dApp staking rewards and increase their revenue by using tradable liquid nASTR tokens.

The goal of liquid staking is to solve problems such as liquidity and the efficiency of fund usage. Users constantly face a choice: protocol staking or farming/liquidity mining in dApps, and this solution allows users to obtain the preferences of both ways simultaneously.

With new version 1.5 of Liquid Staking, Algem adopts the dApp Staking philosophy a bit more by supporting multipools and allowing users to decide on which project they want to stake their tokens.
