### Install Polkadot.js Plugin

To create a Polkadot.js, install the Browser Plugin available for both [Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/polkadot%7Bjs%7D-extension/mopnmbcafieddcagagdcbnhejhlodfdd?hl=en) (and Chromium-based browsers like Brave) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/polkadot-js-extension/). \

After installing the plugin, you should see the orange and white Polkadot{.js} logo in your browser menu bar.
